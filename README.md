# Would you Rather?.. Project

This is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?..” game.

You can also naviagte to the leaderboard to see rankings of users which is dependent on their answers and created questions.

This project is second of the three required projects needed to graduate from the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
